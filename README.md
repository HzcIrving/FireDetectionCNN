# FireDetectionCNN
This project detects fire from images. It uses Convolutional Neural Network and predefined models to extract features from images.


To train modal;

1. put your feeding images in the related part under the "dataset" folder
2. open "train_model.py" and insert your parameters like model type, batch size etc (upside of the code)
3. Run the code and observe your model saved under "trained_models" folder


To test model;

1. Put your test images under "test_images" folder
2. In "test_model.py" code, insert parameters like your pretrained model name, test image name etc
3. Run the code and observe console
